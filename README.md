# eigenfaces in R
 Working - yet functional - version. Shall be released to CRAN soon.

Install with:
```
devtools::install_github("vbonhomme/eigenfaces", build_vignettes=TRUE)
library(eigenfaces)
```

And have a look to the vignette:

```
browseVignettes("eigenfaces")
```

Feel free to contact me should you have any idea/suggestion/critics/request/etc.. The preferred place is [issues](https://github.com/vbonhomme/eigenfaces/issues) but here is my mail:
